# DEO

Back in 1993 I released my first computer program. It was a data visualization tool for extragalactic objects. I wrote it in assembler on my Commodore Amiga 2000. It was included on the freeware disk series TIME DISK 182. I will republish it here soon under GPL V3.

At the time of publication in 1993, I was not aware that "DEO" was the word for God in the Latin language. However, considering the fact that the program places the viewer outside the extragalactic space, one could suspect an allusion here. However, it is a completely unintentional coincidence.
