# DeO

Back in 1993 I released my first computer program. It was a data visualization tool for extragalactic objects. I wrote it in assembler on my Commodore Amiga 2000. It was included on the freeware disk series TIME DISK 182.

Herewith I release this software under the GNU GPL version 3. Unfortunately I don't have the source code anymore, but I'm still looking for it and/or trying to disassemble it. Back then I used the assembler Devpac 3 to write DeO. In the unlikely case that you are interested in the source code, I recommend you to disassemble the program. If you succeed, I would be happy to get the recovered source code and add it to this repository. 

I developed this program as project work in astronomy in High School (German: Gymnasium). Back then I found a 3D to 2D algorithm in a hacker magazine for fans of the C64 and reimplemented it in m68k assembler for my Amiga computer.

At the time of publication in 1993, I was not aware that "Deo" was the word for God in the Latin language. However, considering the fact that the program places the viewer outside the extragalactic space, one could suspect an allusion here. However, it is a completely unintentional coincidence.
